This repository hosts my dotfiles.
The setup is performed through a bash script that tackles installation of packages as well as [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to create symlinks.

## Requirements

Use Arch or a flavour of it, I personally use [Endeavour](https://endeavouros.com)

## Usage

``` bash
# Clone repo locally:
git clone https//www.github.com/glaaj/dotfiles`

# Run `install.sh` to install Ansible using pip
./setup.sh
```
